# HOW COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD CELEBRATE NEW YEAR’S DAY?

# Denmark
While in some cultures, breaking things is a bad sign, Danish people welcome New Year’s Day by smashing unused plates and glasses against the doors of family and friends. This action is performed with the aim of warding off evil spirits. Some people even stand on chairs and jump off of them together at midnight in the hopes of bringing good luck.

They also celebrate this day by listening to the Queen’s speech before proceeding to the Royal Palace in Copenhagen to await the clock’s chime.

# Spain
People in Spain have a unique way to celebrate New Year’s Day. It is a custom to eat 12 grapes at midnight on New Year’s Eve, one at each stroke of the clock. Each grape is a representation of a month of good fortune in the coming year. If you are able to get all of them into your mouth, all of your wishes will come true!

Eating grapes and passing around bottles of cava while gathering in main squares in big cities like Madrid and Barcelona are some popular activities of Spanish people on New Year’s Eve.

Another tradition is to wear coloured underwear, with each colour representing a different wish for the new year.

# Greece

The most popular colours for the New Year are red (which is thought to bring love) and yellow (which is believed to bring money).
